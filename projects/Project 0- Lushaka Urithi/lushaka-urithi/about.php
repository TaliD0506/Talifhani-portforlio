            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2025, LushakaUrithi was born from a passion to preserve and celebrate South Africa's rich cultural heritage through traditional clothing and accessories. Our name combines "Lushaka" (meaning heritage in several South African languages) and "Urithi" (Swahili for inheritance), representing our mission to connect people with their cultural roots.</p>
